<!-- ABOUT -->
## About

Provision Jenkins to AWS with this Terraform template. This will create several AWS resources: VPC, EC2s, Security Groups, Subnets, etc. 

The Jenkins Controller and a Jenkins Agent will be provisioned on two separate EC2 instances.

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
* [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)

3. [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
4. [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

IaC to manage your CI/CD infrastructure. Once deployed, ensure to consult the [documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/), configure Jenkins for your environment, and write a [Jenkinsfile](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/) under your project repository.

Ensure to sign into the AWS CLI.

```bash
aws login
```

Modify the data sources and resources to match your current environment. See my blog post for an explaination [here]().

Initalize Terraform, validate the plan to provision the AWS resources, and apply.

```bash
