[Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) is a prompt theme engine for any shell which means it is cross platform for any shell language like Bash, zsh, or Powershell. Since we just set up WSL, we can get this working for both our PowerShell and Bash prompts.

1. If on Windows, ensure you install a [Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) on the Windows system itself.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts.git
cd nerd-fonts
./install.ps1 FiraCode
```
Replace FiraCode with any font you like. 

2. Oh My Posh does come with prebuilt themes, however, I found it easier to extract a theme directly to the home folder, customize it, then load it from there. The following are the themes I use for [PowerShell](https://github.com/caz-iii/win10/blob/master/grandpa-style.omp.json) and [Bash](https://github.com/caz-iii/win10/blob/master/sven.omp.json). You can download those or choose your own theme [here](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/themes).

3. In the terminal settings > Appearance > select the Nerd Font you downloaded. Ensure this is done for both PowerShell and each distribution you use. You can also change the background color from there.

4. If using WSL, install the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager on the Linux system side.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

5. Next, we can install Oh My Posh. It was easier for me to have separate installations for WSL and PowerShell.

From PowerShell:

```powershell
winget install oh-my-posh
```

From WSL:

```bash
brew install jandedobbeleer/oh-my-posh/oh-my-posh
```

6. Next, we need to add the oh-my-posh command to our $PROFILE variable on Windows and either our .bashrc or .profile for WSL. In my case, the .bashrc configuration didn't work for me and I had to put the command in the .profile file.

On the Windows side:

```powershell
notepad $PROFILE
```

Add the following line, replacing it with whichever theme you chose:

`eval "$(oh-my-posh init bash --config ~/grandpa-style.omp.json)"`

Save and exit the terminal.

On the WSL side:

```bash
nano .profile
```
Add the following line, replacing it with whichever theme you chose:

`eval "$(oh-my-posh init bash --config ~/sven.omp.json)"`

Save and exit the terminal.

7. Last thing is to reload the terminal. If all the changes were successful, you should now see your custom prompt load as soon as the terminal starts. If not, double check the [documentation](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs) to see if any steps changed.
