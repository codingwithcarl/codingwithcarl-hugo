The majority of my blog so far has been about DevOps and cloud infrastructure tools such as [Docker](https://www.codingwithcarl.com/posts/2021-11-30-docker/), [Kubernetes](https://www.codingwithcarl.com/posts/2022-04-21-kubernetes/), and [Terraform and Jenkins](https://www.codingwitharl.com/posts/2023-10-13-jenkins/). ... going to start a series about application development, specifically web applications from a full stack developer perpective.

In this post, I'll lay out a sample dev environment with all the tools needed to get started. We're going to be building an application using the following:

* JavaScript & React on the frontend

* Java & Spring Boot on the backend

* MariaDB as our backend database

I'm going to go over the tool that I use (or have used). Alternatives certainly exist, so feel free to swap in whatever you are familiar with. Professionally, I use Windows to develop on, while personally, I use Linux; I'll include instructions for both. With Linux, there may be some differences in package managers. Ensure to consult your distro's documentation or do a search to see what packages are available to you.

## JDK, MVN, NPM

### Java Development Kit (JDK)

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

#### Windows

To get OpenJDK installed, I used [Winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) which is a native Windows package manager.

`winget install AdoptOpenJDK.OpenJDK.17`

After installing, confirm the java command works by running: `java --version`

```
> java --version
openjdk 17.0.8 2023-07-18
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-17.0.8+7 (build 17.0.8+7)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-17.0.8+7 (build 17.0.8+7, mixed mode, sharing)
```


#### Linux

To install the JDK on Linux, I usually consult [Fedora's guide here](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/installing-java/). OpenJDK is also available on Debian-based distro's and you can install like this:

`sudo apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk`

After installing, confirm the java command works by running: `java --version`

```
> java --version
openjdk 17.0.8 2023-07-18
OpenJDK Runtime Environment
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM
```



2. mvn: https://developer.fedoraproject.org/tech/languages/java/java-build-tools-installation.html





`mvn -v`


### Maven

[Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is a software project management tool that makes the software development process simpler and also unifies the development process.

You can also use another project management tool called [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) with Java projects.

The basis of Maven is the Project Object Model (POM). The POM is a pom.xml file that contains basic information about a project. There are also all the dependencies that Maven should download to be able to build a project.


#### Windows

There's a few ways to install Maven: manually, by downloading the binary and manually editing your environment variables, or by checking package managers available to Windows. I used [Choclatey](https://chocolatey.org/) in this example, from an elevated PowerShell prompt:

`choco install maven`


After installation, run `mvn -v` to confirm it installed successfully. You will see your Maven version and it will output the Java Home environment variable. Something like this:

```
> mvn -v
Apache Maven 3.9.3
Maven home: C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\lib\maven\apache-maven-3.9.3
Java version: 17.0.8, vendor: Eclipse Adoptium, runtime: C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.8.7-hotspot
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: Cp1252
OS name: "windows 10", version: "10.0", arch: "amd64", family: "windows"
```

#### Linux

Maven should be available in your distro's package manager.

Debian: `sudo apt install -y maven`

Fedora: `sudo dnf install maven`

After installation, run `mvn -v` to confirm it installed successfully. You will see your Maven version and it will output the Java Home environment variable. Something like this:

```
> mvn -v
Apache Maven 3.8.7
Maven home: /usr/share/maven
Java version: 17.0.8, vendor: Debian, runtime: /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "linux", version: "6.1.0-11-amd64", arch: "amd64", family: "unix"
```
### Node.js & NPM

#### Windows

`choco install nodejs.install`

#### Linux

`sudo apt install nodejs npm`

## IDE / Code Editors

### IntelliJ

[JetBrains Toolbox App](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/)

[Spring Tool Suite (STS)](https://spring.io/tools)

Current File > Edit Configs > Add > Application > com.codingwithcarl.cardDB.CardDbApplication

#### Linux
jetbrains: https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/

```bash
tar -xzf jetbrains-toolbox-*.tar.gz
cd jetbrains-toolbox-*
./jetbrains-toolbox
```
you can then remove the installation files

```bash
rm- rf jetbrains-toolbox
rm jetbrains-toolbox-*.tar.gz
```

### VSCode || VSCodium

`winget install Microsoft.VisualStudioCode`

`winget install vscodium`


[VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)

[VSCode on Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux)

ES7+ React/Redux/React Native Snippets

ESLint - typos and syntax errors

Prettier

## MariaDB

a widely used open source
relational database

HeidiSQL included



4. mariadb & heidi? https://mariadb.com/downloads/

[dbeaver](https://dbeaver.io)

wget https://dbeaver.io/files/dbeaver-ce_latest_amd64.deb

sudo dpkg -i *.deb

## Java, Spring, & Spring Boot

Some background knowledge: the [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework) provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications - on any kind of deployment platform.

A key element of Spring is infrastructural support at the application level: Spring focuses on the "plumbing" of enterprise applications so that teams can focus on application-level business logic, without unnecessary ties to specific deployment environments.

Spring is considered a "framework of frameworks" where several sub-frameworks or sub-tools exists to simplify the development of complex applications or systems. We'll be going over some of them such as [Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa), and [Spring Secuirty](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security), but the biggest, most notable one is Spring Boot.

[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) is a modern Java-based backend framework that makes development faster than with traditional Java-based frameworks. With Spring Boot, you can make a standalone web application that has an embedded application server.


### Spring Initializr

[Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/)

Project: Maven
Language: Java
Spring Boot: 3.1.4
Packaging: Jar
Java Version: 17
Dependecies: Spring Web ( a base for full stack development and provides an
embedded Tomcat server.) and Spring Boot DevTools (provides us with the Spring Boot developer
tools, which provide automatic restart functionality. It makes development much
faster because the application is automatically restarted when changes have been
saved.)
