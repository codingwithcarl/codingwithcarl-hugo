The majority of my blog so far has been about DevOps and cloud infrastructure tools such as [Docker](https://www.codingwithcarl.com/posts/2021-11-30-docker/), [Kubernetes](https://www.codingwithcarl.com/posts/2022-04-21-kubernetes/), and [Terraform and Jenkins](https://www.codingwitharl.com/posts/2023-10-13-jenkins/). ... going to start a series about application development, specifically web applications from a full stack developer perpective.

In this post, I'll lay out a sample dev environment with all the tools needed to get started. We're going to be building an application using the following:

* JavaScript & React on the frontend

* Java & Spring Boot on the backend

* MariaDB as our backend database

I'll go over what tools are needed. Alternatives also exist, so feel free to swap in whatever you are familiar with.

## Spring & Spring Boot

[Spring](https://spring.io/)

Spring Boot is a modern Java-based backend framework that makes
development faster than with traditional Java-based frameworks. With Spring Boot,
you can make a standalone web application that has an embedded application server.

### Spring Initializr

[Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/)

Project: Maven
Language: Java
Spring Boot: 3.1.4
Packaging: Jar
Java Version: 17
Dependecies: Spring Web ( a base for full stack development and provides an
embedded Tomcat server.) and Spring Boot DevTools (provides us with the Spring Boot developer
tools, which provide automatic restart functionality. It makes development much
faster because the application is automatically restarted when changes have been
saved.)

### Spring Boot

```java
package com.codingwithcarl.cardDB;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class CardDbApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(CardDbApplication.class, args);
	}

}
```

Important Note
It is recommended that you locate the main application class in the root
package above other classes. A common reason for an application not working
correctly is due to Spring Boot being unable to find some critical classes.

Logs and problem solving
Logging can be used to monitor your application flow, and it is a good way to capture
unexpected errors in your program code. Spring Boot starter packages provide a logback
that we can use for logging without any configuration

## Windows

### JDK, MVN, NPM

#### Maven

Apache Maven is a software project management tool that makes the software
development process simpler and also unifies the development process.

You can also use another project management tool called Gradle with Spring
Boot

The basis of Maven is the Project Object Model (POM). The POM is a pom.xml file that
contains basic information about a project. There are also all the dependencies that Maven
should download to be able to build a project.
