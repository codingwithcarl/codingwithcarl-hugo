Recently, I had a task to build a CI/CD pipeline for a Machine Learning Project. Since our cloud infrastructure is heavily tied into AWS, my first thought was to use [CodePipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/). It's native to AWS and doesn't require much overhead. However, as I continued to research different options, it was clear we needed an interface that our client could access and monitor builds while being able to scale out if requirements for compute resources increased. 

My final decision landed on [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) as I have used it from a developer standpoint in the past and am very familiar with it. The new challenge was approaching it from a System Admin or DevOps perspective: deploying a Jenkins server on top of our existing cloud infrastructure and be able to administer it. On top of that, I had to use my previous developer experience and create the build and deploy pipeline based off of the client's workflow. 

## CI/CD

CI/CD or *Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery* is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. The whole nine yards includes building, testing, and deploying. 

CI can be loosely associated with the source code's build process such as using a build tool like gradle or maven for Java which generates a binary artifact or it may involve build a container image using Docker or Podman. CI also encompasses testing, which can involve the use of unit testing tools, such as JUnit, and code analysis, such as SonarQube.  

CD can be loosely associated with the deployment process such as using Ansible scripts to take a binary artifact and copy and run it on a server in the cloud or spinning up containers in Kubernetes, etc. 

## Jenkins

Jenkins is an open source automation server. Jenkins can be used to automate pretty much anything but it is mostly used for CI/CD. Jenkins utilizes a [Jenkinsfile](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/) which defines a set of stages of steps to execute things. Jenkins uses the Jenkinsfile to execute shell scripts and cli tools just like you would from a terminal. The Jenkinsfile is normally held within a project's root directory. 

As a developer, I'm familiar with writing Jenkinsfiles to automate building, testing, and deploying apps. However, in order to do that, we need to deploy Jenkins and have it run somewhere.

## IaC

IaC or *Infrastructure as Code* is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through manual processes. 

Manual process in this case being using the AWS Console (web gui) or the AWS CLI to manually provision the resources we need to stand up Jenkins. If you are just getting started, doing it manually can have some benefit to better understand what is being provisioned visually (which most tutorials online showcase) however, you will always be able to see the result of what you deployed after the fact in the console anyway.

Using IaC is a better practice as it allows you to bundle your cloud configuration in a code repository and makes it easier to create, edit, distribute, and destroy configurations. By codifying and documenting your configuration specifications, IaC aids configuration management and helps you to avoid undocumented, ad-hoc configuration changes. 

There are many tools to use for this. In this case, I'm using Terraform. 

## Terraform

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an infrastructure-as-code software tool...
