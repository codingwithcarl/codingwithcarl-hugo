**Dependency Injection** is a software development technique where we can create objects that depend on other
objects. Dependency Injection helps with interaction between classes but at the same time keeps the classes
independent.

There are three types of classes in dependency injection:

* A **service** is a class that can be used (this is the dependency).
* The **client** is a class that uses the dependency.
* The **injector** passes the dependency (the service) to the dependent class (the client).

classes are loosely coupled
